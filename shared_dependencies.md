Shared Dependencies:

1. **Dependencies in package.json**: Next.js, TypeScript, ffmpeg-wasm, express (for handling server-side routes), multer (for handling file uploads), @types/node, @types/react, @types/react-dom (for TypeScript type definitions).

2. **Exported Variables**: In the utility files (ffmpeg.ts and youtube.ts), there will be exported functions that will be used across the application. For example, `convertVideo`, `cropVideo` in ffmpeg.ts and `uploadToYoutube` in youtube.ts.

3. **Data Schemas**: There might be a shared data schema for the video file being processed. This could include properties like `name`, `type`, `size`, `duration`, etc.

4. **DOM Element IDs**: IDs for the video upload input field (`videoUpload`), the video player (`videoPlayer`), the video converter form (`videoConverter`), and the video cropper form (`videoCropper`).

5. **Message Names**: Messages for successful video upload (`videoUploadSuccess`), successful video conversion (`videoConversionSuccess`), and successful video cropping (`videoCropSuccess`).

6. **Function Names**: Functions for handling video upload (`handleVideoUpload`), video conversion (`handleVideoConversion`), and video cropping (`handleVideoCrop`). These functions will be used in the respective components and API routes.

7. **Shared Styles**: The global styles in `globals.css` will be shared across all components.

8. **Shared Components**: The `VideoUploader`, `VideoPlayer`, `VideoConverter`, and `VideoCropper` components will be used in the main page (`index.tsx`). 

9. **Shared API Routes**: The API routes for upload (`/api/upload`), convert (`/api/convert`), and crop (`/api/crop`) will be used across the application.
